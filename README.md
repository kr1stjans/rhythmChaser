### Installing

### Vision
Let everyone, everywhere learn music in a fun and intuitive way. Start with the most basic musical tool: rhythm. Rhythm can be signaled with applauds, hand beats, anything that moves. We will use phone movement.

* teaching tool in classes: fun and aligned with the 21st century technology - kids will love it
* competing tool between friends: compete with your friends on a fun way and learn more about music
* tool for an individual: when bored and also wanna learn more about music

### Solution
User will move a phone in sync with the songâ€™s rhythm. The better the sync, the more points he will get

### Any songs vs predefined songs
* any songs: happier user that can pick any song that he likes, harder highscore, because highscore must be song-local
* predefined songs: like guitar hero - more control, easier monetization, predefined songs are not necessarily popular and may not be liked

### Highscore
* song-local highscore system, login with facebook, two leaderboards, global and friend-local.

### User interface
* simple ui: score & combo number like guitar hero. Animating scores on each beat? Open for new ideas

### Easy vs hard mode
* see rhythms coming your way, like guitar hero
* see only score

### Problems
* Headaches and handpain after playing it for a while shaking hand
