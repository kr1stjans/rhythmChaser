# rhythmChaser

### Vision
Let everyone, everywhere learn music in a fun and intuitive way. Start with the most basic musical tool: rhythm. Rhythm can be signaled with applauds, hand beats, anything that moves. We will use phone movement.

* Teaching tool in classes: fun and aligned with the 21st century technology - kids will love it
* Competing tool between friends: compete with your friends on a fun way and learn more about music
* Tool for an individual: when bored and also wanna learn more about music

### Solution
User will move a phone in sync with the songâ€™s rhythm. The better the sync, the more points he will get.

* Any song: happier user can pick all the songs that he likes, harder highscore, because highscore must be song-local
Predefined songs: like guitar hero - more control, easier monetization, predefined songs are not necessarily popular and may not be liked
* Song-local highscore system, login with facebook, two leaderboards, global and friend-local.
Simple UI: score & combo number like guitar hero. Animating scores on each beat? Open for new ideas
* Easy vs hard mode: see rhythms coming your way, like guitar hero, vs only score

### Problems
* Headaches and handpain after playing it for a while shaking hand
